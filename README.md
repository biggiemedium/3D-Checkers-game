## Overview

This project represents my journey into learning both the OpenGL rendering pipeline and the Kotlin programming language simultaneously. While the game remains unfinished, the codebase demonstrates various fundamental graphics programming concepts and Kotlin language features.

## Project Goals

- Implement a fully functioning 3D checkers game with modern graphics techniques
- Explore the OpenGL rendering pipeline through practical application
- Gain proficiency in Kotlin's language features and paradigms
- Develop a better understanding of game architecture and state management

## Technical Implementation

The project encompasses several key areas of graphics programming:

- **Rendering Pipeline**: Implementation of vertex and fragment shaders
- **3D Models**: Creation and manipulation of checker pieces and board
- **Lighting**: Basic diffuse and specular lighting for realistic rendering
- **Camera System**: Movable camera with perspective projection
- **Input Handling**: Mouse and keyboard interaction for gameplay

## Learning Outcomes

Though incomplete, this project provided valuable experience in:

- Understanding the OpenGL rendering context and pipeline
- Working with shader programming (GLSL)
- Managing game state in a functional-oriented language
- Implementing 3D mathematics for game development

## Future Considerations

If development were to continue, planned features would include:

- Complete game rule implementation
- Multiplayer functionality
- Advanced visual effects (shadows, reflections)
- AI opponent using minimax algorithm

## Development Environment

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Graphics**: OpenGL
- **Build System**: Gradle
- **Libraries**: LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library)
